# React Apollo GrapgQL testing app
Testing Apollo with graphQL

- create-react-app: boilerplate used for this project
- apollo-client: eveything you need to set your apollo-client
- apollo-boost: is a view layer for your integration for react
- graphql: in order to parse your graphQL queries

1. Apollo-client: helps setting your queries environments ( so to say )
2. ApolloProvider: component wraping your application to set the context of your app  
    allowing to connect your application with your apollo-client
3. Query: a react-component using render props to share GraphQL data
